# Development

The development of the BUSCO core software is led by the Zdobnov Computational Evolutionary Genomics Group at University of Geneva. (http://www.ezlab.org/)

We encourage users to get involved and open [issues](https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco/issues) to discuss new features, usability concerns, and any possible improvements of the core algorithm. Do not write pieces of code with the intention of submitting a merge request without a prior arrangement with the leading development team. The BUSCO master branch is updated through minor and major releases, is validated before publication, and synchronized with the Bioconda and Dockerhub distributions.

If you wish to fork the project for your own use, you are free to reuse the code under the MIT license. See the license file.

# Reporting issues
To help with debugging and improving the tool, please report any issue you might have in the BUSCO GitLab project issue tracker (https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco/issues). Pay attention not to create a duplicated request. Be as comprehensive as possible when reporting a bug, and attach the content of the logs folder whenever it is possible. Use confidential issues *only* when necessary for privacy concerns, otherwise bug reports are always useful to others.
